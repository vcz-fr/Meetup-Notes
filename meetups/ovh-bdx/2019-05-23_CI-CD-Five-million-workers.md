This is an experience feedback of the development and scaling of the CDS product at OVH.

### History

By the end of 2014, OVH, which was fifteen at the time, rocked large monorepos, monoliths and had increasing needs for CI/CD performance. Its solution at the time was to divide the monoliths into micro-services.

Each time is responsible for the applications it develops and the ecosystem it uses. To build and deploy their applications for instance, some teams were using GitLab while others were using Jenking, deploying via shell scripts or with `git pull`. An effort has been maid to standardize the CI/CD process.

By March of 2015, the first results are in: PRs are requested by email, the integration with Atlassian creates it in Stash, starts a CI/CD with Bamboo. This set of tools being integration into the Atlassian Suite, this allowed for a fast integration with tight access controls. This setup was good, with separate environments and automated changelogs but it was limited in terms of scalability, team autonomy, API completeness, had no CLI and no isolation between environments!

Even though the current process was good, it was not relevant for OVH current systems and projects. Therefore, a dedicated cross-functional CD team has been created. This team builds the tools, trains technicians and broadcasts best practices. Its first major project was to solve the CI/CD issue.

### Needs

Years of development brought many languages and technologies into the stack: Go, Python, Java, Rust, OpenStack, Ansible, etc. A new CI/CD solution should be capable to handle all of these and the ones to come. The new solution would also need to account for more diverse needs such as:
- Flexibility in the delivery process. How the pipelines, stages and jobs are executed and in which order, conditional execution, permissions, notifications and templating;
- Extensibility by integrating with an existing ecosystem and additional plugins;
- Scalability by reserving the right resources at the right time. The solution has to aim for minimal wait, minimal waste and customazibility of the environment from the OS to the technology;
- Autonomy; the teams should be able to create and manage projects, related resources and permissions within the new tool;
- High Availability, a REST API, a CLI, self-hostability, reusability, etc.

No tool available at the time could match all of these needs. OVH chose to develop its own. Enters **CDS**.

### Continuous Delivery Service

[100% open source](https://github.com/ovh/cds), developed in Go and Angular. Derives from the needs of OVH and CI/CD's litterature. It reached the point where CDS currently deploys CDS!

**Flexibility:** Workflows are a set of conditional pipelines that can be executed algorithmically and connected by hooks with Git, Bitbucket, Webhooks, Kafka and more. The conditions can also be applied to stages and jobs. You can execute stages for specific environments, for instance.

All environment variables can be utilized to create conditions, from jobs to entire workflows. You could prevent production deployments if it is the last day of the week or the last hour of the day.

**Scalability:** A "hatchery" has been developed in Go. This component, which needs an API token and access to the API, listens for events and responds by generating workers and environments from the jobs prequisites. Hatcheries are compatible with numerous execution environments: Kubernetes, Local, OpenStack, VSphere and many more.

CDS handled a total of 5.7 million workers in 2018. This represented 12k containers per day or 3k VMs. Currently, it is running more than 3k workflows in approximately 250 projects and has gathered more than 700 users. The project also reached 2k stars on GitHub!

**Autonomy:** You can represent your workflow as a YAML and execute that workflow differently depending on environment variables. The YAML specification keeps a strict compatibility with the options exposed in the interface and vice-versa so that all teams are on the same level, feature-wise.

**Reusability:** In a classic CI/CD solution, jobs and stages can be reused but not entire workflows. With CDS, this is not the case thanks to the workflow templates. A template change can be globally applied its related children workflows!
