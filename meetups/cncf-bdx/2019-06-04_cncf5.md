### K8s vs K3s

Kubernetes is very complicated and that is okay. Even though it is present mostly everywhere today, most of its capacity remains unused. In order for Kubernetes to reach further, Rancher Labs built a lightweight version of it called [K3s](https://k3s.io/). With requirements of 200MB of storage and 512MB of RAM, K3s is the perfect solution for resource-constrained environments.

From vanilla Kubernetes, K3s removes legacy and alpha features, most of the plugins (storage, cloud providers) and replaces [etcd](https://etcd.io/) with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), Docker with [containerd](https://containerd.io/) and uses [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) for service discovery, [Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) as the network fabric, [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) as Ingress Controller and [Helm](https://helm.sh/).
