### News
- [Kubernetes 1.16](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/09/18/kubernetes-1-16-release-announcement/) has been released in September of 2019. It is mostly a stabilization release leaning towards extensibility with the General Availability of [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) and of the Webhooks, the stabilization of the Metrics and the Container Storage Interface (CSI). The next version of Kubernetes is expected for December 2019;
- [Knative](https://knative.dev/) is a solution designed to host serverless workloads on Kubernetes based on [Istio](https://istio.io/), a service mesh. Unfortunately, the governance of Knative is mainly composed of Googlers and recently decided not to donate it to the CNCF. It is to be expected that development from other vendors will slow down as a consequence of Google's decision;
