## Hosting an application on AWS. Free of charge.
By [Adrien Pinson](https://twitter.com/AdrienPinson), Co-founder & CTO @ Yescapa

For Yescapa, Amazon Web Services has been the platform of choice to get the business started. The foundation of their infrastructure has been built with the free tier services. This was their initial architecture:

```
Route 53 ---> CloudFront ---> EC2 ---> Elasticache
                 |--> S3    <--|--> RDS
```

Additionnally, with the [AWS Activate](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/) program, early stage startups can start with a credit to build their initial infrastructure and serve their first customers.

The rest of the presentation consisted in a presentation of the components of the base infrastructure as well as a live demonstration in a fresh AWS account of the CLI commands that would be used to build it.
