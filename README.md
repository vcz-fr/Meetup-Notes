# Meetup notes

This repository contains the notes I have taken during my meetups. My notes are not exhaustive and contain sometimes more than what happens during the actual presentations.

## How to contribute?

Even though this repository is personal, you can report mistakes and propose enhancements so that the notes become richer, available to more minds, etc.
If you are a meetup enthusiast, do not hesitate to contact me so that we can add each other in our READMEs!
