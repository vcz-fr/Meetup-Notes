This repository contains the notes I have taken during events and conferences I attended. They are not exhaustive and
may contain more than what was presented live.

Even though this repository is personal, you can contribute by reporting mistakes and suggesting enhancements so that
the notes become richer and available to more people. Knowledge that is not freely available gets eventually lost.
