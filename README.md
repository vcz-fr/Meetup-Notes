# Meetup notes

This repository contains the notes I have taken during my meetups. They are not exhaustive and may contain more than
what happens during the presentations.

## How to contribute?

Even though this repository is personal, you can report mistakes and propose enhancements so that the notes become
richer, available to more minds, etc. If you are a meetup enthusiast, do not hesitate to contact me so that we can add
each other in our READMEs!
