title: "Angular 17: Rebirth of a framework"
---

By Arthur Lannelucq, Senior Frontend developer @ Mesetys  

Angular went on a long journey to refresh its core components over the last versions. This path culminated in Angular
17, when the team decided to refresh the branding, their website and update the most developer-critical parts of the
framework: compilation, SSR, CLI and control structures. This is a dive into the history of what led to Angular 17.

## Angular 14

Angular 14 introduced [Standalone components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components){:rel="nofollow"} in
replacement for ngComponents. Over time, features and patterns have developed around the concept such as [lazy-loading](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules){:rel="nofollow"}
and encapsulation, but this approach was dependency-heavy, hard to test, reason about and consequentially degraded user
experience. SCAM, which stands for "Single Component Angular Module" developed as the easier path to develop shared
modules for better reusability and easier maintenance at the risk of making the project file structure harder to grasp.
This approach has been described in this [blog post](https://sandroroth.com/blog/angular-shared-scam/){:rel="nofollow"}.

Standalone components are the official answer to this problem: every component —and this includes directives, pipes and
so on— is its own module.

Also introduced in this function is the [`inject()`](https://angular.io/api/core/inject){:rel="nofollow"} method which
can be used to inject dependencies outside the `constructor()` method. This unlocked new patterns for simplifying Route
guards as demonstrated in [this blog post](https://www.danywalls.com/how-to-use-functional-router-guards-in-angular){:rel="nofollow"}.

## Angular 15

Since Angular 15, developers can drop classes for [Guards](https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate){:rel="nofollow"}
and [Route Resolvers](https://angular.io/api/router/Resolve){:rel="nofollow"} as Angular's 14 `inject()` method enables
them to be expressed in functional style for less code and overhead.

Another change is [Directive Composition API](https://angular.io/guide/directive-composition-api){:rel="nofollow"} which
can be used to gather multiple [Angular Directives](https://angular.io/api/core/Directive){:rel="nofollow"} defined as
standalone into one that is the sum of their behaviors! Composing directives makes for more reusable and maintainable
code.

## Angular 16

This version brought many critical changes to the framework, particularly when it comes to detecting changes. Until that
version, naive change detection was implemented in [zone.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js){:rel="nofollow"}.
This implementation was naive as **any** interaction would trigger a complete refresh of the app! To optimize rendering
updates, a system that could better track interaction and changes was needed: [`Signal`s](https://angular.io/guide/signals){:rel="nofollow"}.
Signals notify about changes to the values they are observing and only update components that depend on them.

What is the consequence of Signals for [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/){:rel="nofollow"} and [Observables](https://angular.io/guide/observables){:rel="nofollow"}?
Observable data types are often misunderstood and misused by developers, yet Signals are not meant to replace RxJS
except in very specific cases that deal with synchronous changes. There are ways to convert between Observables and
Signals using the [`toObservable()`](https://angular.io/api/core/rxjs-interop/toObservable){:rel="nofollow"} and [`toSignal()`](https://angular.io/api/core/rxjs-interop/toSignal){:rel="nofollow"}
methods. Today, there is no other way to pass data to Signals than inputs, but their roadmap is promising with features
such as using Signals as Input and Output.

On to Server Side Rendering, where hydration was destructive and caused re-renders that made the webpage blink during
client-side takeover. SSR hydration could be configured as non-destructive in this version. A bigger feature concerns
compilation with the introduction of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/){:rel="nofollow"} and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/){:rel="nofollow"}
that can save up to 80% of the compilation time on larger codebases! This can save massive amounts of CI/CD and
developer time!

Angular [`Input`s](https://angular.io/api/core/Input){:rel="nofollow"} can now be declared as required and their
contents can be transformed automatically into booleans or numbers thanks to the [`booleanAttribute`](https://angular.io/api/core/booleanAttribute){:rel="nofollow"}
and [`numberAttribute`](https://angular.io/api/core/numberAttribute){:rel="nofollow"} transforms. Router parameters can
also be passed directly to the components with the [`bindToComponentInputs`](https://angular.io/api/router/ExtraOptions#bindToComponentInputs){:rel="nofollow"}
option or the [`withComponentInputBinding`](https://angular.io/api/router/withComponentInputBinding){:rel="nofollow"}
`RouterFeature`. And we'll finish this part on Angular 16 with self-closing tags, which has actually been introduced in
15.1 according to [this changelog](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases/tag/15.1.0){:rel="nofollow"}.

## Angular 17

New branding, new logo, new [documentation website](https://angular.dev/){:rel="nofollow"} with interactive components
and tutorials with in-browser code experiments. This version is where high-value preview features go Generally available
such as the CLI generating standalone components by default, Vite and esbuild compilations by default and a simpler SSR
application creation flow. But that's not all.

The biggest change has been introduced in the view language: developers won't need to use the [`*ngIf`](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf){:rel="nofollow"},
[`*ngFor`](https://angular.io/api/common/NgFor){:rel="nofollow"} and [`*ngSwitch`](https://angular.io/api/common/NgSwitch){:rel="nofollow"}
directives and [`ng-container`](https://angular.io/api/core/ng-container){:rel="nofollow"} elements to avoid leaving
traces on the DOM. To replace them, Angular introduced a [new control flow](https://angular.dev/essentials/conditionals-and-loops){:rel="nofollow"}
in templates with `@if`, `@for` and `@switch`. Not only these directives don't need to be attached to be components, but
they also improve the Developer eXperience with their former alternatives: expressions are not constrained by the DOM
attribute limitations, performance improved dramatically thanks to the integration with the templating language (a
performance uplift of up to 90% can be observed for `@for` vs `*ngFor`!) and `@for` made reference tracking mandatory to
track changes in lists and that is a good thing!

If lazy loading was great, its logical evolution is [Deferrable Views](https://angular.dev/guide/defer){:rel="nofollow"}
within templates. This feature can defer the loading of dependencies like pipes, directives and CSS to further reduce
initial bundle sizes and improve user experience. It requires using `@defer` template blocks which support conditions,
placeholder contents with `@placeholder`, while-loading contents with `@loading` and on-error contents with `@error`.
Deferrable Views support multiple triggers in an "any of" fashion and additional options for placeholder and
while-loading contents.

## Questions and Answers

### Can `@defer` triggers be used to implement "all of" conditions?

This may be possible using nested `@defer` blocks or by using `when` conditions that implement that logic. Stay tuned,
this feature may appear on the roadmap if it's requested enough.

### What is `inject()` for? Where can it be used?

`inject()` is to be used in [injection contexts](https://angular.dev/guide/di/dependency-injection-context){:rel="nofollow"}
such as within constructors and field initializers. Dependency Injection allows the framework to do the dependency
wiring for the developer and efficiently manage resource initialization.

### Why use Standalone components?

Standalone components are a view into more composable and reusable components such that a button, an app screen and the
entire application are each a component.

### `Signal`s resemble React states. What are notable differences?

While reactivity exists in Angular with [Reactive Forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms){:rel="nofollow"}, they
are constrained to form inputs and driven by `Observable`s. `Signal`s offer more control over the data and update flows.
Signal updates can invoke one another and don't significantly hamper performance.
