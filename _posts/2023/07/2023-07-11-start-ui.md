## History

So many applications look the same. Create, Read, Update, Delete, interactions, list interfaces. Same choices, same
ideas, same technologies. What if there was a better way to build apps? If we're talking web app, we could reasonably by
start looking for technologies abstracting away the hard parts. TypeScript is one of these with its types,
autocompletions, its capacity to catch errors early, syntactic sugar and its transpiler options. But TypeScript is not
without flaws; type inference arrived later notably for JavaScript events, Pick and Omit are new additions to adjust
types and there are plenty of operators to make types more expressive. It's not perfect and there are other solutions,
but this one will do.

We can consider TypeScript to be our first opinionated choice. What other choices would one have to make before actually
writing their first meaningful lines of code in a new project?

## Technologies
### Frontend

[**Angular**](https://angular.io/){:rel="nofollow"}  
It has grown with structure, with an approach to web development. It's ideal for inexperienced teams. But version
upgrades are complex, the performance leaves to be desired and it's not easy separating it into small dynamically loaded
chunks.

[**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/){:rel="nofollow"}  
Lightweight, library-like. It's easy to work with: learning curve, upgrades, integration. However it's not that
intuitive and quite verbose with no official UI framework and it's difficult to create and maintain components.

[**React**](https://react.dev/){:rel="nofollow"}  
The cleanest Developer eXperience of the trio. Highly extensible, performant, supports TSX and JSX, if fairly
exhaustive, can reach the mobile platform with React Native and CLI interfaces. No conventions are enforced in React and
sometimes migrations can be complex.

### Rendering notions

**CSR**: _Client Side Rendering_  
The application is rendered on the browser. The browser loads the application bundle, loads data and displays content.

**SSR**: _Server Side Rendering_  
The application is rendered on the Node server. There may be a hydration phase client side to add interactivity.

**SSG**: _Static Site Generation_  
The website is built statically then hydrated but the initially delivered content is necessarily static.

**ISG**: _Incremental Static Generation_  
The website is built statically then hydrated, but a Node server regularly rebuilds the page. This avoids rebuilding the
whole application for few changes.

### Scaffolders / Servers

[**Create React App**](https://create-react-app.dev/){:rel="nofollow"}  
Suffers from low maintenance and only implements CSR.

[**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/){:rel="nofollow"}  
A complete solution that is complex to use because of its expansive integration with GraphQL.

[**Remix**](https://remix.run/){:rel="nofollow"}  
SSR-first and difficult to adapt to other rendering modes.

[**NextJS**](https://nextjs.org/){:rel="nofollow"}  
The Developer eXperience is good enough, migrations from JavaScript to TypeScript are simplified and supports all
rendering methods described previously. This framework is simple to pick up if coming from React thanks to their
similarities, plus it supports backend functions thanks to its [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes){:rel="nofollow"}.

### Routing requests

[**Next Router**](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing){:rel="nofollow"}  
The routing is file-based. v12 has its limits regarding layout choice for multi-layout applications —think
administration pages. v13 changes the structure enough that this is not an issue anymore. However, v13 cannot implement
SPA because routing is only backend-side. Other than that this tool is optimal.

[**TanStack Router**](https://tanstack.com/router/v1){:rel="nofollow"}  
TanStack comes with solid and agnostic value propositions. Their libraries, including this one, invest in their
Developer eXperience and are type-safe. Unfortunately their routing library is in Beta. Too young for production but
keep an eye on that one, it's promising!

[**React Router**](https://reactrouter.com/en/main){:rel="nofollow"}  
The most famous and in use, suited for SPA and only SPAs. Its migration from v5 to v6 was a nightmare and the solution
is opinionated to suit Remix.

This one is a more complex decision with no clear winner on the market. You might be best served by a mix between what
Next and React Router offer.

### UI framework

[**Material UI**](https://m3.material.io/){:rel="nofollow"}  
CSS gets computed at runtime, and it supports many components. However, the style looks very Google and the framework is
difficult to customize and extend.

[**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/){:rel="nofollow"}  
Pure CSS, ultra customizable and easy to integrate notably thanks to its support for design tokens. As for components,
Tailwind UI is official non-free alternative for ready to be used components.

[**Chakra UI**](https://chakra-ui.com/){:rel="nofollow"}  
Customizable JS-rendered CSS. Uses component props, supports design systems and tokens and its out-of-the-box components
implement accessibility features. Components themselves are composable for maximum reusability.

### Data and state

**useState / useEffect**  
It's the standard, but it's not a clean one. Blank screen until the data is present, no native error handling,
everything must be reimplemented every time.

[**SWR**](https://swr.vercel.app/){:rel="nofollow"}  
Stale While Revalidate. Cached data is used while new data is being fetched.

[**TanStack Query**](https://tanstack.com/query/latest){:rel="nofollow"}  
Just like TanStack Router, Query is agnostic and has good Developer eXperience. The [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useQuery){:rel="nofollow"}
hook requires a query identifier and a query function to handle the data. Loading state, error handling and request
resends are built-in. It's a wrapper around Promises that adds a configurable layer caching with revalidation.

## StartUI

[StartUI]({:rel="nofollow"}){:rel="nofollow"} implements an administration interface using all the technical choices
discussed here and additional features that will make teams save time during development. This project is [Open Source](https://github.com/BearStudio/start-ui-web){:rel="nofollow"}
and developed by [BearStudio](https://www.bearstudio.fr/){:rel="nofollow"} because they were reimplementing a similar
technical stack on every new project. This battery-packed starter includes configured [ESLint](https://eslint.org/){:rel="nofollow"},
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/){:rel="nofollow"}, [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/){:rel="nofollow"}, i18n, [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/){:rel="nofollow"},
[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/){:rel="nofollow"} and [Formiz](https://formiz-react.com/){:rel="nofollow"}.

Developers can start with StartUI even faster using the generator package [create-start-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-start-ui){:rel="nofollow"}.
Your new project is seconds away, type `yarn create start-ui --web my-project` on the nearest terminal to try it! There
are even starters for native applications and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/){:rel="nofollow"}!

## Questions and Answers

### Is it possible to replace Cypress with Jest in StartUI?

No, it is not yet supported but could soon be for unit tests.

### Why the hesitation between React and Next Router?

The best technology choice for routers is very dependent on the way the application is rendered. For instance, an
application using SSG may need two layers: one for the static part and one for the browser.

### Is route internationalization supported?

NextJS supports path internationalization and user preferences. An alternative would be to create URLs via
redirections to support translations.
