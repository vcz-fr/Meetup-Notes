## Introduction

Like most compilers, Babel works by running three passes:
1. It starts by generating an abstract representation of the code called an Abstract Syntax Tree;
2. It optimizes this representation, effectively simplifying and removing unused elements;
3. It rewrites the remainder in a preset JavaScript format, understandable to the targeted browsers.

Babel is present at each of the decision steps of the Technical Committee 39 or [TC39](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/tc39-rf-tg.htm){:rel="nofollow"}
for short. This committee decides the state of the JavaScript standards and features. The [babel/proposals](https://github.com/babel/proposals){:rel="nofollow"}
GitHub repository contains a Babel implementation of some of these proposals. These proposals can be enabled with the
right packages and options or can be tried out directly in the [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl){:rel="nofollow"}!

## What's new?

Babel 7 comes with massive changes, including, for the most important ones:
- End of the support for Node versions before 6.0;
- End of the presets: now, you can have [one preset package](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/v7-migration#yearly-preset-deprecations-blog-2017-12-27-nearing-the-70-releasehtml-deprecated-yearly-presets-eg-babel-preset-es20xx){:rel="nofollow"}
  to rule them all!
- Scoped packages: Babel packages are now scoped under @babel [[Example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/types){:rel="nofollow"}];
- Babel-Upgrade: to reduce the amount of breakage due to the upgrade, this [new tool](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade){:rel="nofollow"}
  will ease your work;
- Support for TypeScript and React Fragments!
- Pure annotations: a hint for the uglifiers that help them with dead code elimination.

As for some of the most recent proposals:
- Optional chaining: a very cool feature that will allow you to forget checking every nested property before moving on
  to its children [[Proposal](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining){:rel="nofollow"}];
- Object rest spread: a way to do clean Object destructuring [[Proposal](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread){:rel="nofollow"}].

## Questions and details

1. Where can we check the roadmap?  
The roadmap for Babel can be found [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/roadmap){:rel="nofollow"}.

2. Can the pure annotations remove a variable if its purpose is to store a flagged dead function?  
Yes, thanks to the optimization pass after the abstract representation of the code!
