## How Boby cultivates collaboration and innovation
By Jasmin Seren-Rosso, Managing Director & CPO @ Boby  

Are silos a property inherent to large organizations? From prior experience, in such companies communication tends to be
a side effect of Non Conformities being raised or includes higher-ups in the organizational chart. Let's explore how a
smaller company grew from nothing and avoided silos during its formative years.

### Necessary context

The history of the company starts in 2022 with 8 people and an MVP delivered in 8 intense months of work. There a strong
cohesion between development and product teams, probably thanks to the rush. One year later, the team doubled in size
and the product was being sold to customers. The first negative comments ensued: sales did not understand the product
roadmap, designers received features before they were fully fleshed out and there were quality issues here and there.
The company being still young, something could still be done!

### What has been done

To align the different teams on the customer objectives, regular continuous improvement sessions were set up. And from
them emerged multiple decisions such as:

1. **Everybody does support!** Following training, everybody learns to provide support to customers. There is still no
   team dedicated to customer support today and it still works. This provides a direct feedback source for product
   improvements!

2. **Everybody does product!** Essentially, every individual has unique experiences giving them unique points of view.
   This necessitates the creation and maintenance of a second backlog but for ideas! This then translates into
   brainwriting sessions where sales remind the basics of their target customer persona such as their approach with
   digital services. The team thus learns to step into your customer's vision of your product.

3. **Everything is meant to change, eventually.** Everybody can challenge the status quo of the product **and** the
   organization through feedback sessions and by peering. Designers and product owners work together on features to
   ensure they understand them fully, then designers challenge each other on designs, submit them to developers which
   evaluate their feasibility and finally submit the completed feature to salesand marketing teams.

In this organization, the quality is a shared concern and there are many ways to push it like moving to a written
culture. The current culture, built around change management, welcomes the contributions of every individual and values
their uniqueness.

### Questions and Answers

#### How to keep the cultural momentum after reaching critical mass?

Hard to say. For now, with 24 employees, the culture and practices hold. Time will tell, even though the organization
will have to evolve at some point.

#### Are siloes and company size correlated?

No doubt that there's some sort of relation between the two, but the issue might be rooted in how communication breaks
down after too many actors.

## Speech, such a fantastic tool at the tip of our tongues
By Geoffrey Graveaud, DevSecOps Lead & Coach  

Words are used daily to express oneself, exchange, debate sometimes without measuring their impact. Precisely
reproducing an idea is more complex than one can imagine. For instance, think of a dog and of how you would describe it
to a diverse audience. Here are some tools that will help you in that regard:

1. Silence  
Used gracefully, it makes speeches more impactful. People love stories and suspense. Add some breaks, let your words
breathe and use it for emphase. Silence alone is not enough; use it with purpose. This is often the topic of manager
training sessions, as silence is also a tool to get answers from others and to articulate one's thoughts.

2. Stylistic devices  
French has a wide collection of them, all fairly studied in literature classes. Use them at your advantage to sprinkle
additional meaning to your discourse. You may use **hyperbole** to convey enthusiasm or exageration and **anaphora** to
insist on a common link between multiple notions.

3. Body language  
The body speaks as well. To capture attention from the audience, use your sight. Try to imagine a discussion partner
whose eyes are drifting: are you still in a dialogue? Your sight maintains the attention of the audience and your
intention.

Your arms and hands serve the coherence and harmony of your speech. Their posture and movements punctuate and add
intention to your words. Try positioning your hands between your waist and your shoulders then form a triangle with your
fingers, or point your index finger when talking in a rythm, or close your fists. Each position adds a different
meaning.

The tools above were all used in the iconic _"I have a dream"_ speech by Martin Luther King. It's all about training.

#### What is the source of the public speaking hobby?

The trigger was the frustration of not speaking like the other Devoxx 2015 speakers. Since then, Geoffrey has been
learning and practicing public speaking.

#### What are some goot recommendations for the sight?

The recommendations vary depending the size of the audience, though it is generally recommended not to focus too much on
the same point. Deviating from the audience for a brief moment is okay. Then there are strategies, like scanning in the
shape of an "L" or a "W".

## Making a clean sweep of a scope when nobody asked for it
By Pierre Segalen, Mobile & Web Maker @ XII (twelve)

In 2015, in the "mobility" team of a large French e-commerce actor, a revolution was stirring. At the time, the team was
small, comprised of one tech person, and two business and product owners, plus a tech lead / scrum master. The ecosystem
was a monolithic ASP .NET service with native Android and iOS apps that were showing age, developed externally and with
an API that was left to rot for three years. The situation was dire and things weren't moving fast. Let's see, month
after month, how this team undertook a transformation that was not meant to be and changed their company for the better,
durably.

In June of the same year, seeing the evolution of the market, something changed: six tech people, four business people,
an ambitious roadmap, yat still an API that left a lot to be desired and complexity with maintaining the existing
software legacy.

Then disaster struck in July: deep budget cuts. 45M€ had to be saved in six months and this meant freeing no less than
280 contractors. The offices were empty and the relation with the management were at a low. One month went by.

In August, the "mobility" team was looking for work to do, with no success. Redesigning the API was the only sensible
thing to do, so it proceeded without formal validation from the top.

Comes September and another bad news struck: the budget cuts also affects the mobile apps maintenance. The "mobility"
team had to learn about a dozen of technologies from the Android and Apple ecosystems to keep the apps from decaying.
Or... they could implement a hybrid app that could work for both ecosystems using technologies like [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/){:rel="nofollow"} or [Xamarin](https://xamarin.github.io/){:rel="nofollow"}.

October 2015, and the tasks came back. Also with them a presentation of the API redesign effort, which was announced as
75% complete in just 90 days. The architects could not believe it and criticized the design decisions, even though the
feedback was overwhelmingly positive and the project validated!

In December 2015, the release of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/){:rel="nofollow"} shook the tech world! 
Internally, it led to slides and meetings with the CIO. Risks were analyzed, insider information from the React Native
team, return on investment and alternatives were considered. The truly convincing slide was the one that dived into
three scenarios: no app redesign, separate native apps and React Native. Plus one more thing: introduce React on the web
to unity the tech stack and create bridges across web and mobile teams. This sold it.

February 2016 saw the start of this effort. In the end, the old API and apps were decommissioned in a year. This change
has endured the wrinkles of time.

### Questions and Answers

#### In retrospect, how do you feel about the project?

Everything happened when we were young, and at the time we believed the hierarchy has full control over the destiny of
their products. There was an opportunity, we learned to seize it by being bold and detaching from the grind.

#### What was the "return on investment" argument?

The points were taken from everything that was available to the development team. First and foremost, the app stores
with their notes and comments, the bugs, spinners, general slowness and ever increasing time to add new features. These
flaws were common knowledge.

Everything could have been redeveloped from scratch, in native app form. The ROI argument was the only option because
the company had no choice but to comply, as competitors were already seeing 60% of their traffic coming from mobile
devices.

#### Did you have any prior experience with big migrations?

A few yes, but none that required ths much practice or support. Migrating is not about a skill but rather a mindset of
questioning oneself. The code alone cannot embody the context or migration opportunity, there must be business aspects
to justify a migration.
